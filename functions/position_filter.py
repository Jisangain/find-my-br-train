# position_filter.py - Physics-based plausibility checks for crowdsourced
# "I'm inside this train" GPS updates.
#
# Context: most trains get 0 reporters at any given time, occasionally 1,
# rarely 2, and very rarely 3. That means we usually can't rely on consensus
# between multiple simultaneous users to spot a fake/mistaken report - most
# of the defense has to work for a single, lone ping. The checks here are
# built around that constraint:
#
#   - Convert the abstract "position" unit (fractional type-1 station index,
#     e.g. 3.35 = 35% of the way from station 3 to station 4) to real
#     kilometres, using the same haversine great-circle distance already used
#     elsewhere in this codebase (route_calculator.calculate_distance). This
#     matters because a fixed tolerance expressed in "station index units"
#     (the old bounds system) is not physically meaningful: 0.5 station-index
#     can be 300m on a commuter route with closely-spaced stops, or 40km on an
#     intercity route - so the same constant was simultaneously too loose and
#     too strict depending on the train.
#   - Judge a new ping by comparing it to where the train was last known to
#     be and how much real time has passed, using a generous max train speed
#     plus a flat slack distance. The slack absorbs: GPS jitter (a few
#     metres), and multiple simultaneous valid reports from different
#     bogies of the same train (a rake is at most a couple hundred metres
#     long, but we leave real margin here).
#   - Never assume the train is anywhere near its timetabled position - BR
#     trains are frequently 4-5+ hours late, so "expected position right now"
#     from the static timetable is a weak, generous ceiling at best, not a
#     reliable estimate of where the train actually is. The real anchor is
#     "where a real report last put this train, and how long ago was that".
#
# None of this is bot-specific. The caller must run every one of these checks
# for bot-sourced pings exactly like user-sourced ones - an authenticated bot
# is a trusted *identity*, not a trusted *position*.
