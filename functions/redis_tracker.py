class RedisTrainTracker:
    """
    Redis-based train position tracker.
    - Stores last ping from each user per train
    - Auto-expires user data after 10 minutes (TTL)
    - Pre-calculates and caches a position when new data arrives, using
      distance-clustered consensus when several reports disagree
    - Stores last known position for 10 hours (fallback when no active users)
    - Every ping - bot or user - is run through the same plausibility filter
      (functions/position_filter.py): journey-active window, then a real-km
      teleport/speed check against the train's last known position. An
      authenticated "bot" caller (see urls/positions.py) is a trusted
      *identity*, not a trusted *position* - it gets no bypass. (A "can't be
      ahead of the timetable" ceiling was tried and dropped as a hard gate -
      real schedules pad different legs very unevenly, so an on-time train
      can legitimately look tens of percent "ahead" in km on a fast
      non-stop stretch. position_km/scheduled_km are still logged per ping,
      so the same "how far ahead of schedule" signal is available to a
      future ML model - it's just not used as a reject condition here.)
    - Calculates scheduled position automatically from train data
    - Persists across server restarts (stored in Redis)
    - Data validity: positions older than 10 hours are considered invalid
    - Logs every accepted/rejected ping to a local SQLite DB (gps_log.py) as
      training data for a future ML-based fake-GPS classifier
